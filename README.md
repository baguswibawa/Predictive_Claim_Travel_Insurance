# Predictive Claim Travel Insurance

## Project Overview
This project is part of my Capstone as porto, where the primary goal is to predict whether a policyholder will file a claim on a travel insurance product. The project involves building a machine learning model to classify the likelihood of claims based on historical data.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of historical data on travel insurance policies, including details such as:
- **Agency**: The agency handling the policy.
- **Agency Type**: The type of agency.
- **Distribution Channel**: The channel used for selling the policy.
- **Product Name**: The specific travel insurance product.
- **Gender**: Gender of the insured individual.
- **Duration**: The duration of the trip.
- **Destination**: The destination of travel.
- **Net Sales**: The amount of sales generated by the policy.
- **Commission (in value)**: The commission earned by the agency.
- **Age**: The age of the insured individual.
- **Claim**: The target variable indicating whether a claim was filed (Yes/No).

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Scaling numerical features.
   - Feature creation and engineering.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understanding the distribution of claims.
   - Profiling policyholders who are more likely to file a claim.
   - Analyzing the correlation between features.
   - 
### **3. Modeling**
   - Built predictive models using various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
   - Handled class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE, NearMiss, RandomOverSampler (ROS), and RandomUnderSampler (RUS).

### **4. Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated models using metrics such as F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall.
   - Identified the best-performing model based on the applied evaluation metrics.

## **Modeling and Evaluation**
- **Logistic Regression**: Applied with different `class_weight` settings to address class imbalance.
- **Decision Tree**: Tuned to balance performance and interpretability.
- **Random Forest**: Used for its robustness and ability to handle complex data structures.
- **XGBoost**: Implemented to enhance predictive performance using boosting techniques.
- **LightGBM**: Applied as an efficient and fast boosting model, particularly for high-dimensional data.
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: Used for classifying data and reducing dimensionality in a linear manner.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Explored various resampling methods such as SMOTE, NearMiss, ROS, and RUS to address class imbalance.

Despite the efforts, the models consistently showed a low F1-score due to the highly imbalanced dataset.

## Challenges Faced
- **Class Imbalance**: The dataset had a significant class imbalance (1:10 ratio), which led to difficulties in achieving high predictive accuracy.
- **Low Predictive Performance**: Even with advanced techniques like SMOTE, the models' F1-scores remained below expectations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identifying and creating features that could improve model performance was challenging.

## Conclusion
The project highlights the challenges of predicting claims in a highly imbalanced dataset. The models built, while providing some insights, showed limitations in accurately predicting claims, with F1-scores remaining low.

## Recommendations
- **Data Augmentation**: Collect more data, especially on the minority class (claims), to improve model training.
- **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Collaborate with domain experts to identify additional features or external data that could enhance model performance.
